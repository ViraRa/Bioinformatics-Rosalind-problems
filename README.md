# Bioinformatics Stronghold Problems [Rosalind problems] 
### Note: All Projects are written in Python 3
#### These problems may not be in order as they appear on Rosalind. 

**1st Project** - Count nucleotides (A, C, G, T) in a given DNA sequence. Must provide a sample.txt to read the nucleotides. 

**2nd Project** - Transcribe a DNA sequence into a RNA sequence. Must provide a sample.txt to read the DNA sequence. 

**3rd Project** - Find the reverse complement of a DNA sequence. This reverse complement is the non-coding strand while the DNA sequence is the coding strand. Must provide a sample.txt to read the DNA sequence.

**4th Project** - This is a bottom-up approach applied to a Dynammic Programming problem. The problem is called "Rabbits and Recurrence Relation." The project calculates the total number rabbits that are present after n months if every pair reproduction-age rabbits produce k litters. Reproduction age rabbits are ready to produce after the first month. Must provide n and k inputs.   

**5th Project** - Find number of point mutations given two DNA sequences where the second sequnce is right below the first one. Must provide a sample.txt where the first DNA sequence is on the first line and second one is right beneath it. 

**6th Project** - Calculate the dominant allele ratio given a population of k, m ,n. k represents the homozygous dominant organisms. m represent the heterozygous organisms, and n represents the homozygous recessive organisms. The population is given by k+m+n. The problem outputs a probability (decimal format) without replacement. 

**7th Project** - Translate a given RNA sequence into a peptide (peptide consists of one-letter amino acids). Must provide a sample.txt to read the RNA sequence.
