# Rosalind Problems (In Progres and these problems may not be in order)
### Note that all Projects are written in Python 3

**1st Project** - Counting nucleotides (A, C, G, T) in a given DNA sequence. Must provide a sample.txt to read the nucleotides. 

**2nd Project** - Transcribing a DNA sequence into a RNA sequence. Must provide a sample.txt to read the DNA sequence. 

**3rd Project** - Find the reverse complement of a DNA sequence. This reverse complement is the non-coding strading while the DNA sequence is the coding strand. Must provide a sample.txt to read the DNA sequence.

**4th Project** - This is a bottom-up approach applied to a Dynammic Programming problem. The problem is called "Rabbits and Recurrence Relation." The project calculates the total number rabbits that are present after n months if every pair reproduction-age rabbits produce k litters. Reproduction age rabbits are ready to produce after the first month. Must provide n and k inputs.   

**5th Project** - Find number of point mutations given two DNA sequences where the second sequnce is right below the first one. Must provide a sample.txt where the first DNA sequence is on the first line and second one is right beneath it. 

**6th Project** - Calclate the dominant allele ratio give a population of k, m ,n. k represents the homozgyous dominant organisms. m represent the heterzygous organism, and n represents the homozgyous recessive organisms. The population is given by k+m+n. The problem outputs a probability (decimal format) without replacement.
